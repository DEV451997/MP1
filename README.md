## Future Features

Some additonal features I would like to add include:
* I would like to add interactivety to the site using javascript in the future.

# Design and Structure

## Structure

The site is made up of three pages. 

* Landing Page: This contains an introduction to Mt.Olmypus and membership information to prompt the user to check out the gym facilities.
* Facilities Page: This contains all the information regarding the facilities offered at Mt.Olmypus in four fully responsive cards.
* Sign Up Page: This page contains the sign up form. This is the only piece of information on this page to allow the user to promptly sign up.
* The footer and navigation bars spans across all three pages so this is the way to navigate through the site. Also the footer is on all pages so the user is always displayed with the contact information and opening hours at all times.

### Colors

* After researching various gym websites I came to the conclusion I wanted to create a dark and edgy site.
* I mainly used dark colors with the images used on each page very dark to allow contrast between the important information of each page.
* White was mainly used for the text as this provides stark contrast to black allowing the important information to stand out.
* Black was used for text against the white background of the cards for the same reason as above.
* Along with black and white I used crimson red. Crimson is a very strong color and it was used in areas to display importance. For example the images on the facilities page. It was also used as a hover effect on the navigation bar to emphasise what link the user is about to click. It was also used on the input lines in the signup form.

[HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) and [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/) were used to create this project. Information from w3schools is provided via the links.
